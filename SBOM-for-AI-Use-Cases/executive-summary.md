# Executive Summary

Organizations worldwide are rapidly adopting the latest innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). This new technology introduces a range of business, legal, and security risks—many of which require new strategies, but some of which mirror known software supply chain challenges.

Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become a globally adopted standard for managing software supply chain risk. Similarly, SBOM for AIs offer a practical and standardized way to improve transparency, security, and trust across AI systems, supporting stakeholders across security, compliance, governance, and legal teams.

This document provides an overview of SBOM for AIs, focusing on key use cases that help organizations manage risks and responsibilities across industries.

At a high level, SBOM for AIs enable organizations to:

*   **Compliance**: Meet emerging regulatory and customer expectations for AI transparency and accountability through structured, auditable inventories of AI components.

*   **Vulnerability and Incident Management**: Improve visibility into models and datasets, enabling faster impact analysis, dependency mapping, and integration with automated incident response workflows.

*   **Legal and Intellectual Property Protections**: Ensure the permissible use of models and datasets by tracking provenance, licensing, and modifications to avoid regulatory or legal exposure.

*   **Third-Party AI Risk Management**: Gain visibility into vendor-supplied AI systems by identifying underlying models, datasets, and their associated risks for purchasing and operations.

*   **Open Source Model Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the trustworthiness and compliance of publicly sourced models and datasets before integration into internal systems.

*   **Model Lifecycle and Asset Management**: Track model lineage, configurations, datasets, and energy usage to improve reproducibility, lifecycle oversight, inventory accuracy, and sustainability metrics.

## Implementation Priorities

To support AI transparency, security, and compliance, organizations should focus on these key priorities:

*   **Generate SBOM for AIs for internally developed models** using standard formats (e.g., CycloneDX, SPDX) to build a reliable inventory of AI components across the enterprise.

*   **Generate SBOM for AIs for open-source AI models and datasets** to assess risks related to provenance, licensing, and potential compliance or security concerns.

*   **Require SBOM for AIs from third-party vendors** to ensure visibility into externally sourced AI models and datasets as part of procurement and risk management.

*   **Use SBOM for AIs as a foundation for model cards** to standardize documentation and support governance, transparency, and cross-team understanding.

*   **Maintain a unified inventory of all models and datasets** including provenance, lineage, dependencies, and training context for improved oversight and risk mitigation.

*   **Integrate SBOM for AIs into security and compliance workflows** such as incident response, vulnerability management, and regulatory audits.

*   **Automate generation and monitoring of SBOM for AIs** to enable scalable, real-time oversight while reducing manual effort.

*   **Adopt a crawl/walk/run approach**—start small with available metadata rather than delaying until standards or processes are perfect.
