# Appendix B – Acknowledgments

[Back to Table of Contents](../README.md#table-of-contents)

This document was a community-driven effort, developed with the contributions of experts from both the public and private sectors who volunteered their time and expertise outside of their normal responsibilities to plan, draft, and refine this guidance.

The [SBOM for AI Tiger Team](README.md) was led by **Helen Oakley**, **Daniel Bardenstein**, and **Dmitry Raidman**, whose leadership, vision, and coordination were instrumental in shaping the content and direction of this work. We also acknowledge the valuable participation of working group members who brought deep experience in application security, software supply chain, AI governance, and tooling implementation.

Special thanks to our colleagues at **CISA**, and in particular to **Allan Friedman**, for his continuous support and guidance in bringing the community together and advancing the broader mission of software and AI transparency.

Participation in this initiative and inclusion in these acknowledgments do not imply endorsement of the document’s content or conclusions.
