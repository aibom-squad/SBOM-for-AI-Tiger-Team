# Use Case 4: Third-Party AI Risk Management

[Back to Table of Contents](../../README.md#table-of-contents)

## Problem Statement

Organizations increasingly embed third-party AI products and services into internal infrastructure and customer-facing applications. However, a lack of transparency into the underlying models, training datasets, and licensing terms exposes organizations to data privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance, security vulnerabilities, and ethical risks. Without comprehensive insight into these components, risk management becomes reactive and fragmented—leaving organizations exposed to liability and reputational harm.

## Benefits

*   **Comprehensive Visibility into AI Components** - SBOM for AIs reveal which models, datasets, and dependencies are embedded in third-party products—whether proprietary or open-source—including licensing and training context. This transparency is critical for aligning with internal policy and regulatory requirements.

*   **Targeted Risk and Compliance Management** - Understanding what vendors use—and how—enables organizations to assess specific risks like bias, misuse of training data, or security flaws. SBOM for AIs help tailor mitigation strategies and support compliance with regulations like the EU AI Act and industry-specific standards.

*   **Faster Incident Response** - When AI-related issues arise, SBOM for AIs help identify affected components quickly, enabling faster isolation, triage, and response to security, legal, or reputational risks.

*   **Increased Vendor Accountability** - Requiring SBOM for AIs encourages vendors to maintain higher transparency and security standards. Detailed disclosures strengthen trust, reduce uncertainty, and support long-term, responsible partnerships.

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Healthcare Data Handling**

A healthcare provider considers deploying an AI-driven diagnostic tool from a third-party vendor. Using the SBOM for AI, the provider identifies that the tool utilizes models trained on patient data from external sources with insufficient privacy controls. This insight prompts the provider to mandate stricter data governance and privacy assurances before deployment, avoiding potential HIPAA compliance issues.

**Scenario 2: Financial Services and Bias Risk**

A bank is evaluating a third-party AI solution for credit scoring and loan approvals. Reviewing the SBOM for AI, the bank discovers that the model training datasets lack diverse demographic representation, potentially introducing bias. This finding leads the bank to require model retraining or select a different AI solution aligned with regulatory requirements and ethical standards.

**Scenario 3: Vendor Dependency Management**

An organization utilizes multiple AI-enabled services from various third-party providers. A security vulnerability is disclosed in a widely-used open-source language model. Leveraging the SBOM for AI, the organization quickly identifies all impacted third-party products, contacts relevant vendors, and applies mitigation strategies promptly, thereby significantly reducing potential exposure and business disruption.
