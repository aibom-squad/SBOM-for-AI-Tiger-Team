# Use Case 5: Intellectual Property & Legal Usage

## Problem Statement

AI models often arrive at organizations with limited transparency about how they were trained, what data was used, and under which legal or ethical constraints they can be deployed. Without this visibility, organizations risk violating licensing agreements, regulatory mandates, or internal data governance policies—particularly when models are trained on proprietary data, personal information, or regulated datasets.

SBOM for AIs help mitigate these risks by offering a structured, machine-readable inventory of model lineage, provenance, licensing, and usage guidelines. This allows organizations to validate whether a model aligns with legal, contractual, and ethical standards—such as those defined by dataset licenses, model terms of use, and frameworks like the EU AI Act, GDPR, or sector-specific regulations.

## Benefits

*   **Legal Risk Mitigation** – Enables verification of dataset licenses, model usage rights, and training practices to reduce exposure to legal disputes and regulatory violations.

*   **Policy Enforcement** – Supports admission control and governance workflows to prevent deployment of non-compliant or restricted models.

*   **Informed Model Selection** – Provides transparency into data sources, licensing terms, and ethical restrictions to guide safer, compliant adoption decisions.

*   **Oversight of Proprietary Content** – Enhances monitoring of models containing sensitive or proprietary data to protect intellectual property and ensure responsible use.

*   **Regulatory Alignment** – Facilitates compliance with frameworks like the EU AI Act, GDPR, and industry-specific regulations by documenting relevant usage constraints and provenance.

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Unauthorized Training Data Usage**

A financial institution plans to deploy an AI chatbot and needs to confirm whether the underlying LLM was trained using proprietary financial datasets. An SBOM for AI reveals that some training data sources are subject to restrictive licensing, prompting legal review before deployment.

**Scenario 2: Restricted Model Usage in High-Risk Domains**

A government contractor is evaluating an AI model for cybersecurity threat detection. The SBOM for AI identifies that the model is governed by a responsible AI license prohibiting military applications. The contractor must seek an alternative model or negotiate licensing terms.
