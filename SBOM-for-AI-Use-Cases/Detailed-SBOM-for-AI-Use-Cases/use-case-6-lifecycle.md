# Use Case 6: Model Tracking, Reproducibility, and Lifecycle Management

[Back to Table of Contents](../../README.md#table-of-contents)

## Problem Statement

AI model development is inherently iterative, involving multiple rounds of experimentation with varying datasets, hyperparameters, and training methods. Without standardized documentation, organizations struggle to reproduce results, validate model performance, or track how models evolve over time. Traditional software tracking tools are not designed to capture the dynamic nature of AI experimentation.

An SBOM for AI provides a structured, machine-readable artifact that captures comprehensive metadata about data sources, model architecture, training procedures, tuning decisions, and computational environments. This enables accurate model tracking, supports reproducibility, and simplifies lifecycle oversight for audits and internal governance.

## Benefits

*   **Improved Reproducibility** – Captures detailed metadata that enables consistent replication of model experiments and faster validation cycles.

*   **Transparent Model Development** – Provides a clear record of datasets, configurations, and training steps, supporting internal reviews and stakeholder confidence.

*   **Lineage and Provenance Tracking** – Establishes traceable links across model versions, supporting audit readiness and regulatory compliance.

*   **Streamlined Collaboration** – Centralizes model documentation in a standardized format, making it easier for teams to collaborate and transfer knowledge.

*   **Lifecycle Oversight** – Enables continuous tracking of models from experimentation through deployment, supporting asset inventory and lifecycle management.

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Inconsistent Dataset Usage**

A data science team discovers inconsistent outcomes due to slight variations in dataset versions used by different researchers. Without clear documentation, identifying the correct dataset version is challenging and may lead to confusion. By adopting an SBOM for AI, the team systematically records dataset versions and usage contexts. This ensures consistent use of datasets, clarity in data provenance, and accurate, reproducible results across experiments.

**Scenario 2: Model Reproducibility Issues**

An external validation team is unable to replicate published model results due to missing or incomplete details about training conditions and hyperparameters. Without comprehensive metadata, discrepancies remain unresolved, diminishing trust in the original findings. Implementing an SBOM for AI captures detailed records of hyperparameters, input data, training methodologies, and computational environments, enabling precise replication and strengthening confidence in the validity of the results.

**Scenario 3: Environment Drift**

A researcher faces difficulty reproducing results from previous experiments due to updates in software libraries and system dependencies, resulting in environment incompatibility. Without detailed environment documentation, reproducing exact conditions may be cumbersome and prone to error. SBOM for AI addresses this by automatically capturing detailed computational environment specifications, including library versions and hardware details, enabling consistent replication and eliminating drift-related discrepancies.
