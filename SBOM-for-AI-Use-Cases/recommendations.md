# Key Recommendations 

[Back to Table of Contents](../README.md#table-of-contents)

SBOM for AI plays a critical role in strengthening transparency, security, and compliance within AI ecosystems. As AI adoption expands, organizations must take a proactive approach to managing risks, ensuring governance, and meeting regulatory expectations. Successfully operationalizing SBOM for AI requires more than documentation—it demands integration into security, risk, and compliance processes and tools, as well as automation for scalability and efficiency.

To effectively implement SBOM for AI and maximize its impact, organizations should focus on the following key areas:

### 1. SBOM for AI Interoperability

Ensuring SBOM for AI aligns with industry standards and can be seamlessly adopted across different sectors is key to its success. Organizations should:

*   Adopt widely accepted formats for SBOM for AI such as SPDX and CycloneDX to ensure interoperability and regulatory compliance.

*   Collaborate across industries to refine SBOM for AI specifications and avoid fragmentation.

*   Engage with regulatory and standards bodies to shape SBOM for AI expectations in emerging laws and compliance frameworks.

### 2. Transparency and Reporting

SBOM for AI provides a clear, machine-readable inventory of AI components, models, datasets, and dependencies to enhance risk assessment, compliance, and accountability. Organizations should:

*   Maintain an enterprise-wide inventory of models, datasets, and dependencies, including lineage, provenance, licensing, and training context.

*   Leverage SBOM for AIs as a foundation for standardized model cards to support governance, documentation, and internal transparency.

*   Include SBOM for AIs for open-source components to surface legal and security risks early in the adoption lifecycle.

*   Use SBOM for AIs to support regulatory audits and internal risk assessments with verifiable, machine-readable artifacts.

### 3. Integration into Security Processes

AI should not be integrated into an organization\\'s business processes without also including SBOM for AI as an integral part of security workflows, ensuring incident response, risk management, and continuous monitoring for AI systems. Organizations should:

*   Embed SBOM for AI into incident response workflows to accelerate impact assessments during AI-related security events.

*   Integrate SBOM for AIs into vulnerability and risk management pipelines to proactively detect issues across model dependencies.

*   Automate SBOM for AI generation and monitoring to ensure real-time visibility and reduce manual effort.

*   Adopt a crawl/walk/run approach—begin implementation with available metadata and expand coverage over time, building organizational maturity without delay.

## **Looking Ahead**

Operationalizing SBOM for AI is not just a compliance exercise—it is an opportunity to strengthen AI resilience, enable responsible innovation, and build trust across AI ecosystems. By extending and integrating SBOM for AI into core security and governance strategies, organizations can future-proof their AI deployments while staying ahead of regulatory and industry shifts.

As AI systems evolve, scaling SBOM for AI adoption across industries will be crucial. Organizations that lead in transparency, security, and automation will be better positioned to navigate AI risks, meet compliance mandates, and drive responsible AI innovation.
