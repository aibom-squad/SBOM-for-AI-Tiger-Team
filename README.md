## Overview of the SBOM for AI Tiger Team

🚀 The SBOM for AI Tiger Team is a collaborative initiative launched in May 2024, following our inaugural AIBOM workshop at RSAC 2024. Since then, we’ve worked across the industry to define real-world use cases, with contributions from distinguished experts and broad community review.

🎯 Our mission is to promote industry-wide transparency, security, and risk management for AI systems through the development of SBOM for AI guidelines.

✅ As a result of our efforts, the team has finalized the first public draft of the SBOM for AI Use Cases, now available for the community to use on this GitHub (see below) and will be published on CISA.gov.

🧩 Our ongoing work involves mapping these use cases to technical formats, such as CycloneDX and SPDX, to facilitate practical adoption. To learn more or get involved, visit [this page](get-involved.md).
